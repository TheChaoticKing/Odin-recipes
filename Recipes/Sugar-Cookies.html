        <h1>Sugar Cookies</h1>
        <img src="/images/Sugar cookies.jpg" height="300">
        <p>Rich and buttery, with just the right amount of 
            vanilla-kissed sweetness. They're soft and chewy, 
            with crisp edges and a center that melts in your 
            mouth as you bite into them</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of all purpose flour</li>
                <li>3/4 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 cup of unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp milk</li>
                <li>Powdered sugar</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt.
                    Set aside.</li>
                <li>Place butter and sugar in large bowl of electric 
                    stand mixer and beat until light in color. Place 
                    butter and sugar in large bowl of electric stand 
                    mixer and beat until light in color.</li>
                <li>Put mixer on low speed, gradually add flour, and 
                    beat until mixture pulls away from the side of 
                    the bowl</li>
                <li> Divide the dough in half, wrap in waxed paper, 
                    and refrigerate for 2 hours.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F</li>
                <li>Sprinkle surface where you will roll out dough with 
                    powdered sugar. Remove 1 wrapped pack of dough from 
                    refrigerator at a time, sprinkle rolling pin with 
                    powdered sugar, and roll out dough to 1/4-inch thick. 
                    Move the dough around and check underneath frequently 
                    to make sure it is not sticking. If dough has warmed 
                    during rolling, place cold cookie sheet on top for 10 
                    minutes to chill.</li>
                <li>Cut into desired shape, place at least 1-inch apart on 
                    greased baking sheet, parchment, or silicone baking mat, 
                    and bake for 7 to 9 minutes or until cookies are just 
                    beginning to turn brown around the edges, rotating cookie 
                    sheet halfway through baking time</li>
                <li>Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes after removal from 
                    oven and then move to complete cooling on wire rack. 
                    Serve as is or ice as desired. Store in airtight container 
                    for up to 1 week.</li>
