        <img src="/images/Beef-Wellington.jpg" alt="Beef wrapped in a duxelle, prosciutto, and pastry" height="300">
        <p>It is a classic English dish of beef tenderloin coated in a 
            mushroom pâté, wrapped in puff pastry, and baked</p>
        <p>Beef Wellington can be time-consuming and difficult to make. 
            The tenderloin needs to be cooked until fully done but not overdone, 
            while the puff pastry needs to stay light and airy.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Tie the tenderloin in 4 places to hold its

                    and then season with salt/pepper then sear all

                    coated in olive oil for about 2-3 min</li>
                <li>Set the prosciutto on a sheet of plastic wrapped
                    [about a foot long]. Shingle it to form a large
                    rectangle to wrap fully around the beef</li>
                <li>With a rubber spatula, spread the duxelle

                    dijon mustard</li>
                <li>Allow to cool slightly, then roll up in 
                    the duxelles covered prosciutto using the 
                    plastic wrap to tie it up nice and tigh</li>
                <li>Roll it up tightly in plastic wrap and 
                    twist the ends to seal it completely and 
                    hold it in a nice log shape. Set in the 
                    refrigerator for 30 minutes to ensure it

                <li>Preheat oven 435 degrees F</li>
                <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the 
                    puff pastry out to about a 1/4-inch thickness. 
                    You may have to over lap 2 sheets</li>
                <li> Remove beef from refrigerator and cut off 
                    plastic. Set the beef in the center of the
                    pastry and fold over the longer sides, brushing 
                    with egg wash to seal</li>
                <li>Top with coarse sea salt. Place the beef seam 
                    side down on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Brush the top of the pastry with egg wash then 
                    make a couple of slits in the top of the pastry 
                    using the tip of a paring knife </li>
                <li>Bake for 40 to 45 minutes until pastry is golden 
                    brown and beef registers 125 degrees F on an 
                    instant-read thermometer</li>
